# Grave Escape

If you're using a 60% keyboard, or any other layout with no F-row, you will have noticed that there is no dedicated Escape key. Grave Escape is a feature that allows you to share the grave key (<code>&#96;</code> and `~`) with Escape.

## Usage

Replace the `KC_GRV` key in your keymap (usually to the left of the `1` key) with `QK_GESC`. Most of the time, this key will output `KC_ESC` when pressed. However, when Shift or GUI are held down, it will output `KC_GRV` instead.

## What Your OS Sees

If you press `QK_GESC` on your keyboard, the OS will see an `KC_ESC` character. If you hold `Shift` down and press `QK_GESC`, it will output `~` (shifted backtick). If you hold `GUI`/`CMD`/`WIN`, it will instead output a simple <code>&#96;</code> (backtick) character.

## Keycodes

|Key              |Aliases  |Description                                                       |
|-----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`QK_GRAVE_ESCAPE`|`QK_GESC`|Escape when pressed, <code>&#96;</code> when Shift or GUI are held|

### Caveats

On macOS, `Command`+<code>&#96;</code> is by default mapped to "Move focus to next window", so it will not output a backtick. Additionally, Terminal always recognises this shortcut to cycle between windows, even if the shortcut is changed in the Keyboard preferences.

## Configuration

There are several possible key combinations this will break â€” among them being `Control`+`Shift`+`Escape` on Windows, and `Command`+`Option`+`Escape` on macOS. To work around this, you can `#define` these options in your `config.h`:

|Define                    |Description                              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|`GRAVE_ESC_ALT_OVERRIDE`  |Always send Escape if Alt is pressed     |
|`GRAVE_ESC_CTRL_OVERRIDE` |Always send Escape if Control is pressed |
|`GRAVE_ESC_GUI_OVERRIDE`  |Always send Escape if GUI is pressed     |
|`GRAVE_ESC_SHIFT_OVERRIDE`|Always send Escape if Shift is pressed   |
